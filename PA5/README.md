# PA5
Matthew Keitelman (mak2vr)
I worked alone on this one (no k-men hexcode)
Group name: pizza.pz

Test file location: Tests/
My tests start with PA5Test_ or TypeError_

My working files:
PA5Test1 - variable declaration and assignment
PA5Test2 - object creation as assignment
PA5Test3 - assign a byte expression to an int variable

My error-ridden files:
TyperErrorOne.java (Return int instead of byte)
TypeErrorTwo.java (Assignment of int to byte)

Your error-ridden files:
PA5dupnameserror.java
PA5dupParam.java
